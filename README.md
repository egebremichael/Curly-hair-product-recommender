# The Curl Guidance - Building Your Perfect Curly Hair Routine

## Project Description
Welcome to The Curl Guidance, a project designed specifically for those with curly hair. In a market predominantly focused on straight hair products, it has often been deemed unprofessional to embrace natural textured hair. Our mission with this project is to offer a dedicated resource for individuals with curly hair to discover and select the best products tailored to their unique needs.

We've carefully curated recommendations, including shampoos, conditioners, leave-in conditioners, as well as styling products, to cater to various curly hair types and preferences.
